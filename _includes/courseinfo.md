# Course description

This course will teach students how to reason about, design, and implement programs that run on parallel machines. We will cover a variety of parallel programming models, parallel algorithms, and styles of parallelism. We will also discuss specific parallel languages and frameworks, including frameworks designed for big data analytics.

# Homework and projects

We'll have three types of assignments in this class:
* Reading commentary assignments: 25% of grade
* Homework: 50% of grade
* Final project: 25% of grade

Submit assignments to the [Catalyst dropbox](TBD).

Late day policy: You have 5 late days, where weekends counts as 1 late day. Past that, each day costs 10% of the assignmentâ€™s grade, a bargain! :-)
