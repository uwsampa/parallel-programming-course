# Schedule

This is the planned lecture schedule. It will get filled in as we go, so please check back.

Each week there will be several readings, including some textbook chapters and influential research papers. Some readings will be marked (required), while the rest are suggested, but highly recommended. In addition, a few of the research papers will require an additional commentary as a homework assignment (bolded). The commentary should be a paragraph describing what you found most interesting or surprising, or asking questions that you have. These commentaries should be submitted to the Catalyst dropbox by the due date given on Catalyst.

Lectures are recorded, and will be available [here](http://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/csep524/16fa/video) a few days after the lecture whenever possible.
