{"name":"CSEP524: Parallel Computation","tagline":"A version of CSEP524 based around the Intel Xeon Phi platform","body":"# Course description\r\n\r\nThis course will teach students how to reason about, design, and implement programs that run on parallel machines. We will cover a variety of parallel programming models, parallel algorithms, and styles of parallelism. We will also discuss specific parallel languages and frameworks, including frameworks designed for big data analytics.\r\n\r\n# Course info \r\n\r\n# Staff\r\n* Instructor: Jacob Nelson\r\n* TAs: TBD.\r\n* Course staff mailing list: [csep524-staff@cs.washington.edu](csep524-staff@cs.washington.edu)\r\n\r\n# Meeting times\r\n* Lectures: TBD\r\n* Office hours by appointment\r\n\r\n# Staying in touch\r\n* Course mailing list: [csep524_TBD@uw.edu](csep524_TBD@uw.edu) (everyone in the class including staff).\r\n* Class discussion board: [https://catalyst.uw.edu/gopost/board/TBD](https://catalyst.uw.edu/gopost/board/TBD)\r\n\r\n# Textbook\r\nLin & Snyder, [Principles of Parallel Programming](http://www.pearsonhighered.com/educator/academic/product/0,3110,0321487907,00.html)\r\n* 2nd printing: preferable due to bug fixes\r\n* 1st printing: [Errata available here](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~lin/errata.html)\r\n\r\n# Homework and projects\r\n\r\nWe'll have three types of assignments in this class:\r\n* Reading commentary assignments: 25% of grade\r\n* Homework: 50% of grade\r\n* Final project: 25% of grade\r\n\r\nSubmit assignments to the [Catalyst dropbox](TBD).\r\n\r\nLate day policy: You have 5 late days, where weekends counts as 1 late day. Past that, each day costs 10% of the assignmentâ€™s grade, a bargain! :-)\r\n\r\n# Schedule\r\n\r\nThis is the planned lecture schedule. It will get filled in as we go, so please check back.\r\n\r\nEach week there will be several readings, including some textbook chapters and influential research papers. Some readings will be marked (required), while the rest are suggested, but highly recommended. In addition, a few of the research papers will require an additional commentary as a homework assignment (bolded). The commentary should be a paragraph describing what you found most interesting or surprising, or asking questions that you have. These commentaries should be submitted to the Catalyst dropbox by the due date given on Catalyst.\r\n\r\nLectures are recorded, and will be available [here](http://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/csep524/16fa/video) a few days after the lecture whenever possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-74529844-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
